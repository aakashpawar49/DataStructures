# ðŸ§  Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my Java solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily practiced from:

- [Striverâ€™s DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)

The purpose of this repo is to strengthen my problem-solving skills in Java while following structured DSA preparation resources.
